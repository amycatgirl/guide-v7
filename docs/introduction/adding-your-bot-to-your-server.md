# Adding your bot to your server

This page assumes you have created a bot account already, if you haven't done so, read the ["Creating a Bot application"](/docs/introduction/creating-a-bot-application) page

### Getting the bot's invite link
  
Go to [Revolt's web app](https://app.revolt.chat), log into your account and head to settings then open the "My Bots" tab as shown in the screenshot below.

Then search your bot's username on the list and click on **"Copy Invite Link"**. This action will copy your bot's unique invite link to your system's clipboard.

### Adding the bot to a server or group

Paste the link into your browser and click it. This will bring you into the bot invite screen.

It consists of the bot's username, description and two dropdowns to choose where to invite the bot to.

If you are inviting your bot into a group, use the "Add to Group" dropdown, if you are inviting it into a server, use the "Add to Server" dropdown.

Now click the *"Add"* button on the right side.

Shortly after clicking add, you should see your bot join the server you've selected!
