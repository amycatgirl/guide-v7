#  Creating a bot application
  
### Creating the bot
Open a Revolt application of your choice or use [the web app on the Revolt website](https://app.revolt.chat/).

Login and go into your [settings](https://app.revolt.chat/settings) (you can find them in the bottom left corner).

Open the ["My Bots"](https://app.revolt.chat/settings/bots) tab.

Then click on **"Create a bot"** (at the top of the screen).

Enter a username for your bot.
  
*Keep in mind usernames of Revolt bots are similar to the ones used by regular users so you are either blocking a username or if you are unlucky your desired bot username is already taken.*

After filling in the username click on **"Create"**.
  
Hurray! You have now created your very own bot!
